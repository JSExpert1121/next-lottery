Its primary purpose is to enable players to win a generous consolation prize if the jackpot is not hit.\r\n\r\nThe superstar is another number with extra costs which offers prize multiplying option.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"play-jackpot\">LARGEST JACKPOTS WON</h2>\r\n<p>In 2009 SuperEnaLotto had gone through continuous rollovers of jackpot prize extending over 8 months.
